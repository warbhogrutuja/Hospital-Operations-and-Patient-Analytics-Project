## Project Overview

The **Hospital Operations and Patient Analysis Dashboard** is a data analytics and visualization project developed to analyze hospital operations, patient flow, department performance, and resource utilization.

The project transforms hospital data into interactive dashboards that help hospital management understand operational trends, identify areas requiring attention, and support data-driven decision-making.

This project was developed as part of the **Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship 7.0** in the **Data Analysis & Visualization** domain.
